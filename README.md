# Brain-Tumor-Image-Classification-using-transfer-learning

Three models for brain tumor image classification using transfer learning was built during this project to find the model with highest accuracy.
The models tested are ResNet50, VGG16 and EfficientNet B0. Of the three models EfficientNet reached an accuracy of 98%. You can read about the experiment and project in the PDF file Brain Tumor Image Classification.
